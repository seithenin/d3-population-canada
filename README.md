# D3 Generated Maps

I created these maps using data from Statistics Canada. Statistics Canada provides accurate provincial bondaries that I converted, simplified, and rendered, reducing the final data size from over 54MB to 84KB.

Using this data I performed the necessary calculations to display the growth rate of each of the provinces in the second map.
